# onion-checker
a python script to check if a website in the tor network still online

# how it work
you need to execute tor to expose the socks proxy on port 9050 , otherwise you can open the tor browser in windows to use the script and it use the port 9150 but it's slower than the tor bundle .
# why i made it 
i made it because i was using https://ahmia.fi and a lot of sites where down and i spent a lot of time on checking them, i would love if the ahmia owner can add it as a checker with a cron to clean up the DB from inactive websites
